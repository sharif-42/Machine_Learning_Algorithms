    "The K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is a classification algorithm that takes a bunch of labeled points and uses them to learn how to label other points. This algorithm classifies cases based on their similarity to other cases. In K-Nearest Neighbors, __data points that are near each other are said to be neighbors.__ K-Nearest Neighbors is based on this paradigm. Similar cases with the same class labels are near each other. Thus, the distance between two cases is a measure of their dissimilarity. There are different ways to calculate the similarity or conversely, the distance or dissimilarity of two data points. For example, this can be done using Euclidean distance"
