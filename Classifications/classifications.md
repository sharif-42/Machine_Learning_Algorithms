# Classifications
### What is classifications?
In machine learning classification is a supervised learning approach which can be thought 
of as a means of categorizing or classifying some unknown items into a discrete set of classes. 
Classification attempts to learn the relationship between a set of feature variables and a 
target variable of interest. The target attribute in classification is a categorical variable 
with discrete values. 
### How does classification and classifiers work? 
Given a set of training data points along with the target labels, classification determines 
the class label for an unlabeled test case.
