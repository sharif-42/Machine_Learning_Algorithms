# Dissimilarity of Numeric Data

we describe distance measures that are commonly used for computing the dissimilarity of objects described by numeric 
attributes. These measures include the Euclidean, Manhattan, and Minkowski distances.

## Euclidean Distance

The most popular distance measure is Euclidean distance (i.e., straight line or “as the crow flies”). 
Let `I = (xi1, xi2,xi3, ....... and xnn)` and ````j= (xi1, xi2,xi3, ....... and xnn)````  
$$ e=mc^2$$
and  be two objects described by p numeric attributes. The Euclidean distance between objects i and j is defined as
