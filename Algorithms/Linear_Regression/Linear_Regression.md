# Linear Regression

## Regression
Regression is the process of predicting a continuous value*.In regression, there are two types of variables, 
a dependent variable, and one or more independent variables. The dependent variable, 
can be seen as the state, target, or final goal we study, and try to predict, 
and the independent variables, also known as explanatory variables, can be seen as the causes 
of those states. The independent variables are shown conventionally by X, and the dependent variable 
is notated by Y. Our regression model relates Y, or the dependent variable, to a function of X i.e. 
The independent variables. The key point in the regression, is that our dependent value should be 
continuous and cannot be a discrete value. However, the independent variable or variables, 
can be measured on either a categorical, or continuous measurement scale.

## Types of Regression:
**Types of Regression:**

- ***Simple Regression:*** Simple regression is when one independent variable is used to estimate a dependent 
variable. It can be either linear, or non-linear. For example, predicting CO_2 emission using the 
variable of engine size. Linearity of regression, is based on the nature of relationship between independent 
and dependent variables.

- ***Multiple Regression:*** When more than one independent variable is present, the processes is called multiple 
linear regression. For example, predicting CO_2 emission using engine size, and the number of cylinders in any
 given car. Again, depending on the relation between dependent and independent variables, it can be either linear
  or nonlinear regression.

## Regression Algorithms:

- Ordinal Regression.
- Poisson Regression.
- Fast Forest Quantile Regression.
- Linear, Polynomial, Lasso, Stepwise, Ridge Regression.

- Neural Network Regression.
- Decision Forest Regression.
- Boosted Forest Regression.
- KNN Regression.

### **Linear regression:**

Is the approximation of a linear model used to describe the relationship between two or more variables.
There are two variables, a dependent variable and an independent variable.  
The key point in the linear regression is that **our dependent value should be continuous and cannot be a 
discrete value**. However, the independent variables can be measured on either a categorical or 
continuous measurement scale. There are two types of linear regression models.They are 

- ***Simple regression:*** is when one independent variable is used to estimate a dependent variable. 
For example, predicting Co2 emission using the engine size variable.

- ***Multiple regression:*** When more than one independent variable is present the process is called multiple linear 
regression, for example, predicting Co2 emission using engine size and cylinders of cars.
